first we will set the environment for our proect 
so write a command for it  "conda create -p ./venv python=3.11 -y

"
and then activate the environment by writing the "conda activate ./venv
"
to check use python --version or pip list

if what to connect with git use "git init" then create a readme file

how want to add this file to git repo use "git add README.md  if there is some error like user change or owner change run this command "git config --global --add safe.directory 'D:/data science tut/MLProject'

and then run this git add README.md

use second one "git commit -m "first commit""get the ' 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
create mode 100644 README.md ''  output

git status use for check the status  

add on git repository we use git commads that is given during hte creation    

git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/adityaranu37/MLProject.git
git push -u origin main          //push the data

run all three individually 

you get some authoirization permission after that it will seet on your github
before if ask for email id and user you have to give with some command that is given on the git 
 

create the git ignore on the git by jjust write after the mlproect/__________ and select language


use git pull to updation of created file

creating the setup.py file so that the proect is createdd in package so that u can use it download it 

what we have done til yet is 
1.set up git  hub repository
a.new environment
b.requirements.txt
c.setup.py

2.src folder and build the packages   to add on git use git add .
